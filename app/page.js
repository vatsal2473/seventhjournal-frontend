It was frustrating and made me feel insecure about my job. On the bright side, I was able to fix the problem and we got through it. After work, I met some friends for a yoga class and it was my way to relax and de-stress from earlier. Overall, it was an up-and-down day, but Iâ€™m thankful for the good moments and look forward to a fresh start tomorrow.");
